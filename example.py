# The 'stitched_image.png' file located in the root directory illustrates the process of map construction.
# The map is created by stitching images together along their edges to form a contiguous grid.
# As the user zooms in beyond a specific threshold on the y-axis, the current image transitions into a new set of detailed image tiles.
# Managing this transition efficiently requires an AI tool, as manually handling such a large collection of images would be impractical and time-consuming.
